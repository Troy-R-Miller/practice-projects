# Practice Projects 

Project 1 - Data Set 1: 

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate data extraction using regular expressions. The objective was to successfully pull numerical strings from the txt file and convert the strings to integers, before calculating the sum of all integers. 

Project 2 - web_scraper_linksearch

The objective of this project was to identify 'name' within a host url at 'x' position after cycling through the scraped url 'y' amount of times. The url used for the project contains internal links to student pages which change positions every few seconds. By creating a simple web scraper, scripted to collect user input and collect data within a range(cycle), I was able to successfuly identify ('name' within page url) at 'x' position after cycling through the given host url 'y' times. The provided parameters were (18, 7) respectively. 

Project 3 - web_scraper_test

The objective of this project was simple; scrape the given url for students scores (comments) and provide the sum of all scores. Once the proper tag was identified, we were able to look at all parts of the tag and convert the contents of the tag into an integer, leading to the sum of all scores

Project 4 - JSON / XML Data Extraction 

This project was designed to exemplify methods learned to extract data from JSON and XML files. The data to be extracted from the XML and JSON files were essentially the same. We were tasked with identifying reading each file, and identifying comment counts in each. Once the comment counts were set in a list, we were to count the items and calculate the sum. In the JSON file, I went as far as to assign the desired JSON list to "item_location" doing this allowed me to visualize the list as a whole and maintain a clear path to the solution.  

Project 4 - Using Python to access geocoding API 

We initiated this project to identify a specific JSON key and value of a desired address location. We were edit, debug and elaborate on a program that gains access to Geo Location API, and retrieves the locations plus_code. This was a fun project and it helped me confirm my ability to analyze JSON data to successfully extract proper data points with a program. Applying guardian code to this program allowed me to work through tests without many tracebacks. I commented print statements that any user can look at an implement said statements as needed to identify the proper keys are being retireved from JSON data.
